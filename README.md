# simple-course-fetcher

This is a very simple and elementary script/module used for fetching data on courses
using the "urllib.request" and "json" modules.

Can currently only be used  on the University of Helsinki API,
e.g. "https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/stats/api/courses"
If you use some other JSON data, it will just be converted to a file by default
(which is, IMO, quite useful a lot of the time).

However, more universities' APIs can be quite easily implemented,
so contributions are most definitely welcome.
