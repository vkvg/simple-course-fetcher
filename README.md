# simple-course-fetcher

This is a very simple and elementary script/module used for fetching data on courses
using the _urllib.request_ and _json_ modules.

Can currently only be used on the University of Helsinki API [main courses page](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/stats/api/courses), but
if you use some other JSON data, it will just be converted to a JSON file by default.
(which is, IMO, quite a useful feature).

However, more universities' APIs can be quite easily implemented,
so contributions are most definitely welcome.
